suggestions for improvement:
- This code implements bcrypt password hashing, which is related to user authentication but doesn't directly address JWT authentication as detailed in the chapter content. It focuses on password storage and comparison, not JWT generation, verification, or usage in securing routes.
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each function, especially the asynchronous workers.
- The code uses bcrypt, which is good for password security. However, ensure that the key derivation function (KDF) parameters (rounds) are set appropriately for the current threat model.
- Implement proper error handling for bcrypt functions. The current error handling primarily uses exceptions, which might not be suitable for all scenarios. Consider using error codes or structured error objects.

- Since the provided code does not address any of the steps outlined in the JWT authentication guide (setting up a Node.js/Express app, installing dependencies, creating authentication endpoints, generating/verifying JWTs, securing routes, using cookies, implementing token refresh), it cannot be considered a solution to the problem. It might be a helper function used in other context but is irrelevant here.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code snippet appears to be related to JWT signing and verification functionalities, but it's not directly implementing the steps outlined in the chapter content. The chapter focuses on building a Node.js/Express application with JWT authentication, including user registration, login, route protection, token refresh, and cookie handling. The provided code is a lower-level utility for signing and verifying JWTs, and not the higher-level application logic described in the chapter.
- To align the code with the chapter's requirements, you would need to show code snippets that demonstrate the following: Express route handlers for registration and login, password hashing with bcrypt, JWT generation using jsonwebtoken, middleware for JWT verification, setting JWTs as HTTP cookies, and implementing token refresh logic.
- Consider providing examples of how the signing and verification functions are used within the context of the larger application described in the chapter.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code appears to be a JWS (JSON Web Signature) verification library, which is a component used *within* JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. However, the chapter content asks for an *implementation* of JWT authentication in Node.js with Express, including setting up endpoints, middleware, and cookie handling.  This code snippet doesn't address those requirements directly.  It's a utility library, not a complete implementation.
- The code should implement the steps outlined in the Chapter Content, such as user registration/login endpoints, JWT generation, middleware, and cookie storage, instead of only providing JWS functionality.

- Consider using a more efficient data structure (e.g., a Map) if the number of users grows significantly to improve the performance of `findUserByEmail` and `findUserById`.
- The type `UserRecord` contains the password hash. This is acceptable, but remember to never store plain text passwords.
