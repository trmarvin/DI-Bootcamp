/* üåü Exercise 6 : Challenges
Evaluate these (ie True or False) */

[2] === [2] // false, because each array is distinct even though their values are the same
{} === {} // false, the same is true of objects

// What is, for each object below, the value of the property number and why?

const object1 = { number: 5 }; 
const object2 = object1;

const object4 = { number: 5};

object1.number = 4;
console.log(object2.number) // 4
console.log(object3.number) // 4
console.log(object4.number) // 5 because this is a new object and retains its value (is not dependent on the others)
