/* 🌟 Exercise 6 : Employees #2
Using the filter() method, create a new array, containing the students that passed the course.*/

const students = [{name: "Ray", course: "Computer Science", isPassed: true}, 
               {name: "Liam", course: "Computer Science", isPassed: false}, 
               {name: "Jenner", course: "Information Technology", isPassed: true},

               {name: "Jamie", course: "Big Data", isPassed: false}];

const passedStudents = students.filter(student => student.isPassed);

console.log(passedStudents);

/* Bonus : Chain the filter method with a forEach method, to congratulate the students with their 
name and course name (ie. “Good job Jenner, you passed the course in Information Technology”, 
“Good Job Marco you passed the course in Robotics” ect…) */
