suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `__add__` method should return a new `Currency` object instead of just the sum of amounts. This maintains object immutability, a best practice in object-oriented programming.  The same applies to `__iadd__` which should return `self`.
- Exercise 2 requires creating two separate files (`func.py` and `exercise_one.py`).  The provided code only shows the solution within the single file. 
- Exercise 5 calculates the time difference without handling potential timezone issues or daylight saving time shifts for better accuracy. Using only `datetime` may cause slight inaccuracies.
- In Exercise 6,  input validation could be improved to handle various date formats or provide more informative error messages.
