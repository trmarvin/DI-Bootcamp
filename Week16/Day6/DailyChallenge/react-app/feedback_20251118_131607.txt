URL: URL: https://github.com/trmarvin/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week16/Day6/DailyChallenge/react-app/src/App.jsx
suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using the URLSearchParams API for constructing the query string instead of manual string concatenation. This can improve readability and reduce potential errors related to URL encoding.
- Using `window.location.href` will cause a full page refresh. Consider using a routing library such as React Router if you want to navigate within your application without full page reloads, offering a smoother user experience.

URL: URL: https://github.com/trmarvin/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week16/Day6/DailyChallenge/react-app/src/FormComponent.jsx
suggestions for improvement:
- The URL parameter 'lactoseFree=on' should be included in the URL only when the checkbox is checked. Currently the FormComponent doesn't handle this. You will need to adjust your handleSubmit to include only the checked properties
- Consider using more descriptive variable names where appropriate to enhance readability, especially in the context of props.
- The component could be further enhanced by adding input validation to the `age` field or other fields as necessary.
