Exercise 3: Dogs Domesticated

Step 1: Import the Dog Class
In a new Python file, import the Dog class from the previous exercise.

Step 2: Create the PetDog Class
Create a class called PetDog that inherits from the Dog class.
Add a trained attribute to the __init__ method, with a default value of False.
trained means that the dog is trained to do some tricks.
Implement a train() method that prints the output of bark() and sets trained to True.
Implement a play(*args) method that prints “ all play together”.
*args on this method is a list of dog instances.
Implement a do_a_trick() method that prints a random trick if trained is True.
Use this list for the ramdom tricks:
tricks = ["does a barrel roll", "stands on his back legs", "shakes your hand", "plays dead"]
Choose a rendom index from it each time the method is called.

Step 3: Test PetDog Methods
Create instances of the PetDog class and test the train(), play(*args), and do_a_trick() methods.
