- This code appears to be ESLint configuration, not code related to building an Express server and React form as described in the problem. Therefore, it does not address the problem at all.
- The ESLint configuration itself seems reasonably well-structured, but without the React and Express code, its utility in this context is zero.

- The code provided is a test suite for an `inspect` function, seemingly related to object inspection and formatting for debugging purposes. This code is completely unrelated to the prompt, which asks for building a React app with an Express server to handle form data submission and display.
- The submission should include two separate projects: a React application in a 'client' folder and an Express server in a 'server' folder. The React app should contain a form that POSTs data to the Express server. The server should handle the POST request and send back a response to be displayed in the React app.
