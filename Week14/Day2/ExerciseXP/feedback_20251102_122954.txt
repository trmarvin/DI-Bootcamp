- The route `/books` should be `/api/books` to align with the requirements in exercise 2.
- Consider adding validation to the `POST` route to ensure that the `title`, `author`, and `publishedYear` are provided and of the correct type. This will improve robustness and data integrity.
- The `id` generation in the `POST` route is simplistic (`books.length + 1`). This can lead to issues if books are deleted. A more robust method (e.g., using a UUID library) would be preferable for production systems.
- Missing implementation for `PUT` and `DELETE` methods as outlined in Exercise 1. While Exercise 2 focuses on basic CRUD, Exercise 1 requires all four operations.
