URL: URL: https://github.com/trmarvin/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week14/Day6/rss-reader/node_modules/xmlbuilder/lib/XMLNode.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The code provided appears to be a utility for XML manipulation, possibly related to building XML documents. While XML might be used in the context of RSS feeds (which are often XML-based), the code itself doesn't directly address the task of fetching, parsing, or displaying RSS feed data as outlined in the problem description. The core task involves using `rss-parser` to process an RSS feed and then displaying the data using Node.js, Express, and EJS.
- The code doesn't include any of the server-side logic using Express to create routes, handle requests, or render EJS templates. It also doesn't demonstrate the use of the `rss-parser` library to fetch and parse the RSS feed, which is a central requirement of the task.
- The code doesn't show how the data is being displayed on the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which form an integral component to delivering a functional RSS reader application as specified in the chapter content.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code provided is just the `package.json` file, outlining the dependencies for the project, but it does not include the `server.js` file with the actual implementation of the RSS reader application. The instructions require the creation of `server.js` with specific routes and functionality to fetch and display RSS feed data. Without this core logic, the application cannot function as intended.
- To make it a valid response to the problem, the `server.js` file must be included with the necessary `express` routes and `rss-parser` logic.
- The static files are missing, which are required by the problem.
