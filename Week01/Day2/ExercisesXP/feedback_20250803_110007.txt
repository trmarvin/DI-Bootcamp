suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 3: The code should not just provide the answers; it should print them to demonstrate the output to the user.
- Exercise 5 is missing.
- Exercise 8:  The funny messages could be improved for better humor and engagement. Consider adding more variety or personalization.
- Add comments to explain the logic in each exercise, particularly in more complex examples (although these are quite simple).
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly addresses most of the exercises outlined in the chapter content.  Exercises 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are implemented correctly. However, Exercise 3 only shows the answers as comments rather than running the code and printing the output which aligns with the chapter's request to 'Predict the output'. Exercise 5 is entirely missing.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward.  The use of f-strings in Exercise 4 enhances readability.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs the required operations without unnecessary overhead. The time complexity of all solutions is O(1) except for the user input which depends on user interaction, which is not a performance concern in this context.
- security: No security risks are present in this code as it only involves basic input/output operations and mathematical calculations. There's no external data handling or user authentication involved.
