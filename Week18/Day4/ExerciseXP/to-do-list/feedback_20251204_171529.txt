suggestions for improvement:
- This code configures ESLint, which is a linting tool for JavaScript. While useful for a React project, it doesn't directly implement the todo list application as described in the prompt.
- The code does not create a Redux store, define actions or reducers, or build React components for a todo list.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is an HTML template, likely for the entry point of a React application. It does not include any Redux-related code or React components as requested by the exercise instructions, so it cannot be assessed for correctness against the problem description.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet is a `package.json` file, which only lists the project's dependencies and scripts. It doesn't contain any actual implementation of the React-Redux to-do list application as described in the instructions.
- The instructions specifically require the creation of a Redux store, defining actions and reducers, and developing React components. This file provides none of those elements.

suggestions for improvement:

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider moving the inline styles to a CSS file or using a styling library for better maintainability.
- While the code is functional, adding PropTypes can improve component documentation and help catch potential bugs related to prop types.

suggestions for improvement:
- This CSS code, while potentially part of a todo list application, doesn't directly address the core requirement of the exercise, which is implementing the todo list logic using React and Redux.
- The code focuses on styling, while the prompt requires implementing Redux store, actions, reducers and connecting them to React components.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code only sets up the Redux Provider. It needs to include the implementation of actions, reducers, and React components to qualify as a complete todo list application as requested by the exercise.
- The actions, reducers and the react components for todo app has to be added into the project.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using constants for action types to avoid typos.
- Add comments to explain complex logic, especially in the reducer.
- Although not required in the exercise, consider using Redux Toolkit to simplify Redux setup.

suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code is a Vite configuration file, which is not related to the requested todo list application using React and Redux.
- Implement the todo list application as described in the instructions, including Redux store setup, actions, reducers, and React components.
- Create actions for adding, toggling, and removing todos.
- Implement reducers to handle these actions and update the state immutably.
- Design React components to display and interact with the todo list.
