suggestions for improvement:
- The code provided is a `package.json` file, which describes a Node.js module named `math-intrinsics`. While this file is well-structured and contains useful metadata about the package, it does not implement any of the API building exercises described in the chapter content. The exercises specifically require creating Express.js APIs with CRUD operations for blog posts or books, involving route handling, data storage (in-memory or via API calls), and response generation.
- To address this, the submission needs to include the actual `server.js` or `app.js` files containing the Express.js code that defines the API endpoints and their corresponding functionalities as outlined in the exercises.
