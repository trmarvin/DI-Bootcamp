suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is the implementation of the Express Router, which is a core component of the Express.js framework for handling routing in web applications. While it's technically correct and functional in its own context, it completely misses the point of the exercise, which is to create a specific emoji guessing game API.
- The code doesn't address any of the specific requirements of the emoji game, such as creating an array of emojis, generating random emojis, handling form submissions, or managing player scores. It's a low-level routing mechanism, not a game implementation.
- The submission should contain code that directly implements the emoji guessing game functionality as described in the problem description, including setting up an Express server, defining API endpoints for the game, and implementing the game logic.
