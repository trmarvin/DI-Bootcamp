URL: URL: https://github.com/trmarvin/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week12/Day6/ExercisesXP/exercise1/app.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The app.js code is incomplete for exercises 2 and 3. It only includes the basic setup, but lacks the implementation for mounting the router for the to-do list and books API as described in the instructions.
- For exercises 2 and 3, the corresponding router modules (todos.js and books.js) are missing their implementations. The instructions mention the required CRUD operations, but the code is not provided.
- The instructions provide placeholders for in-memory databases (todos and books). These need to be implemented in the respective router modules along with the necessary logic to manage them.
