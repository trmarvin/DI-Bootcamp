- This code is completely unrelated to the trivia quiz game described in the problem statement. It appears to be code related to string encoding, specifically handling encodings like UTF-8, CESU-8, base64, etc., likely from a library for encoding/decoding text. Therefore, it doesn't address any of the requirements of the quiz game, such as setting up an Express app, creating routes, managing quiz questions, or tracking scores.
- Since the code doesn't implement the required quiz game functionality, there's no need to analyze its readability, performance, or security in the context of the problem statement.
