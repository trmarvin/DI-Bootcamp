suggestions for improvement:
- This submission consists of a `package-lock.json` file, which outlines dependencies for a Node.js project. However, it lacks the core Express.js code needed to create the trivia quiz game as described in the prompt.  The instructions specifically require setting up an Express.js application, creating a trivia quiz model with hard-coded questions, implementing routes using `express.Router` for GET `/quiz`, POST `/quiz`, and GET `/quiz/score`, tracking the user's score, providing feedback, and implementing game logic. The `package-lock.json` file, while necessary for managing dependencies, does not fulfill any of these requirements on its own.
