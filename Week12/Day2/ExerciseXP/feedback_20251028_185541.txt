URL: URL: https://github.com/trmarvin/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week12/Day2/ExerciseXP/Exercise3/app2.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The submission uses ES6 module syntax, but Exercise 3 explicitly requires CommonJS syntax. The code needs to be refactored to use `require` and `module.exports`.
- The `readFile` function should handle errors and return a value or throw an exception that the calling code can handle.  The current code assumes `readFile` works synchronously and without errors.
- The code directly uses the return value of readFile, implying synchronous reading. Exercise 3 doesn't state the read and write operations are synchronous or asynchronous. It is essential to use the callbacks or promises returned by the asynchronous methods to ensure the program operates correctly, instead of assuming the return value is immediately available.
- The submission does not include the fileManager.js file, which is essential for this task to be completed.

URL: URL: https://github.com/trmarvin/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week12/Day2/ExerciseXP/Exercise3/create.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet appears to be incomplete and doesn't define the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions, nor does it import the `fs` module, which is required by Exercise 3. The instruction was to create a `fileManager.js` that exports `readFile` and `writeFile` functions, which `app.js` (this code) then imports and uses. This code directly calls `readFile` and `writeFile` without them being defined.
- The file creation calls are also present in this snippet which should have been done separately or within the definition of the `writeFile` function inside `fileManager.js`.
Correctness: 0%
-----
URL: URL: https://github.com/trmarvin/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week12/Day2/ExerciseXP/Exercise3/filemanager.js
suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 3 specifically asks for CommonJS syntax, so you should be using `module.exports` and `require` instead of ES6 `import` and `export` statements.
- The use of try...catch blocks is good for error handling, but consider re-throwing or returning an error code to allow the calling function to handle the error more gracefully.
- Asynchronous file operations using `fs.readFile` and `fs.writeFile` are generally preferred for better performance, especially for larger files, to avoid blocking the event loop. However, since the problem doesn't explicitly ask for asynchronous operations, the synchronous versions are acceptable, but not optimal.

- This code snippet appears to be a utility function related to object iteration, possibly from a library like lodash. However, it's not directly implementing any of the specific exercises outlined in the chapter content, which focus on Node.js modules, file system operations, and creating/using custom modules.
- The code doesn't address the instructions to create files (products.js, shop.js, data.js, app.js, fileManager.js, todo.js, etc.), use the 'fs' module for reading/writing files, or work with CommonJS and ES6 module syntax for exports and imports.
