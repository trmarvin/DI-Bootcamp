suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 3 explicitly requires the usage of CommonJS syntax, while the provided code uses ES6 module syntax (import/export).  The code needs to be refactored to use `require` and `module.exports`
- The provided solution does not handle potential errors during file reading and writing operations. Error handling should be added for a more robust solution.
- The prompt asks you to create another file named `app.js`, but you have not included the `fileManager.js` file to assess if the files can be written and read.

suggestions for improvement:
- The submission only shows calls to 'readFile' and 'writeFile' but does not provide their implementation, rendering it incomplete and non-executable.
- The code attempts to directly call functions 'readFile' and 'writeFile' without importing or defining them. The exercise specifically asked to define these functions within a module.

URL: URL: https://github.com/trmarvin/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week12/Day2/ExerciseXP/Exercise3/filemanager.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The exercise specifically asks for CommonJS syntax (using `require` and `module.exports`), but the solution uses ES6 module syntax (`import` and `export`). This is a direct contradiction of the exercise instructions.
- The code provided should be in a file named `fileManager.js` and export two functions, `readFile` and `writeFile`. The functions should use the `fs` module to read and write files respectively.
- Also, the prompt asks to Create a file 'Hello World.txt' containing the sentence 'Hello World !! ' and Create a file 'Bye World.txt' containing the sentence 'Bye World !! '.

- Without context from the exercises, it's impossible to assess its correctness in relation to the chapter's goals.  It's a generic function and not specifically tailored to file system operations, module creation, or usage of npm packages.
- To align with the chapter content, submissions should demonstrate the use of `fs` for file reading/writing, the creation and use of Node.js modules (CommonJS or ES6), or the integration of packages like lodash or chalk.

The chapter focuses on Node.js modules, the `fs` module, CommonJS and ES6 module syntax, and using npm packages like chalk. This code doesn't address any of those topics.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code appears to be a utility function for iterating over object properties, possibly from a library like lodash. However, it is not directly related to any of the exercises outlined in the chapter content, which focus on Node.js modules, file system operations, and ES6/CommonJS syntax. Therefore, it does not address any of the specified instructions.

URL: URL: https://github.com/trmarvin/DI-Bootcamp/blob/main/Week12/Day2/ExerciseXP/math-app/node_modules/lodash/forOwnRight.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The code provided is a function `forOwnRight` which iterates over properties of an object in the opposite order. This functionality is not directly related to the chapter's exercises which focus on Node.js modules, the fs module, and creating/using custom modules and packages.
- The chapter exercises cover topics like exporting and importing modules using CommonJS and ES6 syntax, file management using the fs module, creating a todo list application, and using npm to install and utilize packages like lodash and chalk.
